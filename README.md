slick2d-startup-basic
=====================

This is my very first try on the slick2d Game Framework(Basics only)

These are the very basics of an 2D Game.

Including Characters,Monsters,Sounds and Hitboxes.

From there you can extend it as much as you like.

=====================

Requirements:

1. Slick2D Framework
2. Java Ogg Vorbis decoder
